<h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <li>Warm the milk to about 110 degrees F (43 degrees C), then stir in the yeast and 1 tablespoon of the sugar. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes, until it becomes frothy.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine the yeast mixture with the egg, egg yolk, remaining sugar, and melted butter. Gradually add the bread flour, mixing until a dough forms.</li>
    <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 8-10 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic. Place it in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Punch down the dough and roll it out on a floured surface into a rectangle about 16x12 inches.</li>
    <li>Spread the softened butter over the dough. In a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar and cinnamon, then sprinkle this mixture evenly over the buttered dough.</li>
    <li>Starting from one of the long edges, tightly roll up the dough into a log. Cut the log into 12 equal slices and place them in a greased baking dish.</li>
    <li>Cover the dish with a damp cloth and let the rolls rise for another 30 minutes. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until they are golden brown.</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven and let cool slightly before serving. Enjoy your delicious homemade cinnamon rolls!</li>
