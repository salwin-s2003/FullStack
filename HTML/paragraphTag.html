<p>The world is the totality of entities, the whole of reality,
     or everything that exists.[1] The nature of the world has been
      conceptualized differently in different fields. Some conceptions
       see the world as unique, while others talk of a "plurality of worlds". 
       Some treat the world as one simple object, while others analyze the world
        as a complex made up of parts.</p>
<p>In scientific cosmology, the world or universe is commonly defined as 
    "the totality of all space and time; all that is, has been, and will be". 
    Theories of modality talk of possible worlds as complete and consistent ways
    how things could have been. Phenomenology, starting from the horizon 
    of co-given objects present in the periphery of every experience, defines the world as 
    the biggest horizon, or the "horizon of all horizons". In philosophy of mind, the world 
    is contrasted with the mind as that which is represented by the mind.</p>
<p>Theology conceptualizes the world in relation to God, for example,
     as God's creation, as identical to God, or as the two being interdependent. 
     In religions, there is a tendency to downgrade the material or sensory world 
     in favor of a spiritual world to be sought through religious practice. 
     A comprehensive representation of the world and our place in it, as is found in religions,
      is known as a worldview. Cosmogony is the field that studies the origin or creation 
      of the world, while eschatology refers to the science or doctrine of the last things
    or of the end of the world.</p>
